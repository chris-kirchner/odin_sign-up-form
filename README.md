The Odin Project - Sign-Up Form

This project focuses on the form element, input elements, labels, and validation. We were to create an account sign-up form for an imaginary business/service.

I challenged myself to create a responsive webpage using @media queries for approximate mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes. I also used javascript to check that the "password" and "confirm password" input fields match. For demonstration purposes the password only needs to be 3 characters or more in length, and the webpage will provide feedback if that requirement is not met. Feedback is also provided if an invalid email address is entered. Lastly, the "email", "password", and "confirm password" fields all need to have valid input before the "Create Account" button is enabled.
